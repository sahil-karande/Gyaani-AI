# 🧠 Gyani – My Personal Voice Assistant Web Project

**Gyani** is a voice-based assistant web application that I built from scratch as a personal project. It was designed to understand spoken commands, fetch information from the web, and respond both visually and through speech. The main goal behind Gyani was to explore the integration of speech recognition, APIs, and dynamic web UI in a simple but powerful assistant.

## ✨ Features

- 🎙️ Takes **voice input** using the browser’s Speech Recognition API  
- 📚 Uses the **Wikipedia API** to fetch and display real-time answers  
- 🗣️ Converts text responses to **speech** using the Web Speech Synthesis API  
- 🖼️ Dynamically shows **images and text** related to the query  
- 🧠 Understands simple questions like:  
  - “Who is APJ Abdul Kalam?”  
  - “What is Artificial Intelligence?”

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For building the frontend  
- **SpeechRecognition API** – For capturing and processing voice input  
- **Text-to-Speech API** – For speaking responses  
- **Wikipedia API** – For fetching relevant data and summaries

## 📌 Why I Built It

As an AI engineering student, I wanted to create a project that combines voice technology with real-time data fetching. Gyani was a fun and challenging way for me to apply what I learned about JavaScript, APIs, and user interaction. It also helped me understand how to work with asynchronous data and dynamic DOM updates.
